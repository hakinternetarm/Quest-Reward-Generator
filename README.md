# Quest Reward Generator

This Java program generates a sequence of rewards ('b' for bronze and 's' for silver) that mimics a specified statistical distribution pattern.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuestRewardGenerator.git
   cd QuestRewardGenerator

2. **Compile the Java program**:

javac QuestRewardGenerator.java

3. **Execution**:
java QuestRewardGenerator

 **Customization**:

You can customize the number of quests generated by modifying the N variable in the main method of QuestRewardGenerator.java.
Adjust the interpolate(double t) method in QuestRewardGenerator.java to change the distribution pattern of rewards ('b' and 's').

**Notes**
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run the program.
This program uses a deterministic method to generate sequences based on predefined statistical patterns.
Adjust the probabilities and patterns in interpolate(double t) for different reward distribution behaviors.
